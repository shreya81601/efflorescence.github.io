					        <p>A Company which specializes in Black Clothing lines for Men and Women of all age groups.</p>
							<p>This was my first website which is built around a video from NYUAD's IM CommLab class as a part of the 30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF). The cast in the video can be seen throwing black clothes around and having a lot of fun, hence a black clothing website which uses that as its hype/promo video.
							I personally love wearing black clothes and inspired by the cheerful, happy vibe of the video, I went for a playful, yet subtle theme for my website. Black is the master of colors, especially in terms of clothing bacause it goes with every attire and is suitable for any ocassion. It has a certain boldness to it, hence the title 'Bodacious Black'. </p>
							<p>I tried to bring out this characteristic in my web page and designed it specifically to suit the above.
							The choice of colors, the layout and the pictures strive to create a look of a highend brand, one that is sophisticated, but not too elegant to seem very expensive. I wanted to ensure that my site has an approchable and affordable feel to it.</p>

					        <p>SPOOKY NIGHT is a web-based comic, designed for halloween, which aims to create a friendly, enjoyable narrative for the purpose of entertainment. It outlines the story of two ghosts who talk about the human world on Halloween (as opposed to us humans thinking abouts ghosts on this occasional day). One of the ghosts - Pie - thinks that she is very smart, hence the other one - Pumpkin - decides to test her by asking a series of silly joke-cum-riddles. Since, it is a prank played by Pumpkin on Pie, the user gets a sense that the questions won't be very legit, rather funny and stupid which are designed as such that one won't be able to guess them easily if they use 'common sense'.</p>

							<p>I aimed to create a cheerful, friendly website which would keep this theme in mind. Hence, I used very comicy and cartoonish illustrations which hint at the rustyness and unsophistication of the entire idea, giving it a playful vibe. I intended to keep it a light-hearted humour that is not very intense, thus the choice of solid colors (with slight gradients) and block illustrations. The color pallete I used is inspired by the Halloween themed story.</p>

					        <p>Throughout history, many tribes and sects across the globe have shared a very deep bond with mother Earth and would sense it as a living being. They could feel and connect with nature like no one else. One such practice involved rituals of rainmaking in which tribes established a bond with nature and invoked rain through their earnest and beautiful singing. </p>
					        <p>Nowadays, we are losing this bond and treating our planet rather harshly. Thus, The Magic of Rainmaking is a website which presents a soundscape of a few tribes from different parts of the world engaging in rain-calling rituals. Through this site, we aim for the users to reconnect with nature and remind themselves of the beautiful bond that they can share with nature.</p>

							<p>To make the user feel as close as possible to nature and conect with the tribes while navigating the site, hence we chose backgrounds which pictures forests, leaves, farmlands, village houses etc. and some of them being gifs to give a more realistic experience. The background sound of chirping birds on homepage was also an attempt to make user feel as if they are already in a soundscape which has taken them on journey through the wonders of nature.</p>

					        <p>Not enough time for self-care? Come visit our site to see myriad of self-care tips designed specifically to cater the the varying amounts of time you may have on hand!</p>

							<p>These days, we often come across many people who are so busy with the n number of things in their life that they start neglecting themselves. Self-care is a priority and this is the message we wish to spread through our page. We want to encourage people to take out time for themselves and do whatever makes them feel good and happy. We emphasize on “normalizing” the ways to self-care because often self-care is misunderstood. People think self-care is just limited to eating healthy, exercising regularly etc. But NO! Self-care is very broad and could mean very different things to different people. The most uncommon of the ways – particular to oneself – are often the best ways to self-care.</p>

							<p>Often people say that they don’t not have enough “time” to self-care – a very common excuse. Hence, our website clearly gives user the choice to input the available time at hand and learn about the self-care tips they could engage in for that duration of time. The 3 steps of how-to are very simple and easy and aim to make self-care fun for the user so that they don’t make any excuses anymore! </p>
